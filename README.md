Random Color Picker
PROJECT
It’s time to build fluency in React fundamentals. In this next Pro Project, 
we’re going to practice working with multiple components 
in React so you can hone your skills and feel confident taking them to the real world. 
Why? It’s important to understand the relationship between parent and child components 
and how they can interact. What’s next? Deciding on a color, family interactions, more React. 
You got this!

To run this I would need to create a new app in react: 
1. npm install -g create-react-app
2. create-react-app random_color_picker
3. cd random_color_picker
4. npm start
